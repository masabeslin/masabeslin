I’m a fourth-year PhD student in the <span sty>[Linguistics Department](http://linguistics.umd.edu/){:target="\_blank"} at the [University of Maryland](https://www.umd.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. My advisor is [Masha Polinsky](http://www.mariapolinsky.com/){:target="\_blank"}.

Very broadly, I’m interested in exploring what the combinatorial limits of natural language tell us about its general properties. My research is primarily in the subfields traditionally called syntax and morphology, with an empirical focus on Slavic and Mayan languages. My thesis asks the following questions: What are the basic building blocks of syntax and how do they map onto lexical categories, as traditionally construed? Does structure-building look the same above and below the ‘word’ level? Are locality constraints that operate above and below the ‘word’ level the same or different?
 
I'm affiliated with [UMD’s Guatemala Field Station](https://languagescience.umd.edu/beyond-umd/guatemala-field-station){:target="\_blank"}, where I've gained fieldwork experience in K’iche’. My research on this language has examined exceptive constructions, antipassives, ellipsis, and the widely held (but not closely scrutinized) view that Mayan languages lack the category Tense.
