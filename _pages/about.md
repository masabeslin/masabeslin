I’m a first-year PhD student in the <span sty>[Linguistics Department](http://ling.umd.edu/){:target="\_blank"} at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.umd.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. My advisers are [Masha Polinsky](http://www.mariapolinsky.com/){:target="\_blank"} and [Omer Preminger](https://omer.lingsite.org/){:target="\_blank"}.

Very broadly, I’m interested in exploring what the limitations of natural language can tell us about its general properties. My research is in morphology and syntax, with an empirical focus on Slavic languages. My previous work explored the properties of bare-NP adverbials, specifically the locus of their case and their relation to overt PPs.

More recently, I’ve been thinking about participles in Serbo-Croatian and cross-linguistically. In the winter of 2020, I was fortunate enough to spend two weeks at [UMD’s Field Station](https://languagescience.umd.edu/beyond-umd/guatemala-field-station){:target="\_blank"} in Patzún, Guatemala, learning Kaqchikel (Quichean, Mayan). I hope to return there as soon as possible to do fieldwork that will inform my ongoing research.

Before coming to Maryland, I completed my undergraduate degree at the [University of Novi Sad](http://www.uns.ac.rs/index.php/en/){:target="\_blank"}, Serbia. I am still involved with [NSLing](http://nsling.org/en/){:target="\_blank"}, a research group based at UNS.
