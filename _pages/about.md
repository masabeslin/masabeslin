I’m a second-year PhD student in the <span sty>[Linguistics Department](http://linguistics.umd.edu/){:target="\_blank"} at the [University of Maryland](https://www.umd.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. My advisors are [Masha Polinsky](http://www.mariapolinsky.com/){:target="\_blank"} and [Omer Preminger](https://omer.lingsite.org/){:target="\_blank"}.

Very broadly, I’m interested in exploring what the limitations of natural language can tell us about its general properties. My research is in morphology, syntax and semantics, with an empirical focus on Slavic and Mayan languages. Some of the topics I have been interested in are as follows: mixed categories (participles and nominalizations), inter- and intra-linguistic variation in the size of nominal phrases and its repercussions (the NP/DP debate), bare-NP adverbials (specifically, the locus of their case and their relation to overt PPs), and the interplay of telicity, event complexity and grammatical aspect in Slavic.
 
I'm affiliated with [UMD’s Field Station](https://languagescience.umd.edu/beyond-umd/guatemala-field-station){:target="\_blank"} in Patzún, Guatemala, where I stayed in the winter of 2020. Due to the current situation, my colleagues and I have recently been using online communication tools to carry out our fieldwork. Since March 2021 I have worked with K’iche’ speakers, mainly examining the widely held (but not closely investigated) view that Mayan languages lack the category Tense.

Before coming to Maryland, I completed my undergraduate degree at the [University of Novi Sad](http://www.uns.ac.rs/index.php/en/){:target="\_blank"}, Serbia. I am still involved with [NSLing](http://nsling.org/en/){:target="\_blank"}, a research group based at UNS.
